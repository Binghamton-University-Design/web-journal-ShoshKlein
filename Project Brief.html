	            <p class="sides">The idea for this project is Rapunzel told in two ways. The two versions will be the Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm version from 1857 and the new Disney version from 2011. The version from 1857 is a much darker and more gritty story, while the Disney version is a far more upbeat story and focused on the love and strength aspect. Since the Disney version is a much longer movie and a much shorter children’s book, the wording will be slightly changed to fit on the page but still maintain all of the points from the movie. For this reason, the story will remain the same, but the wording will be edited.<p>

	           <p class="sides">A little backstory for each version begins with the Brother’s Grimm. Two German scholars named Ludwig Carl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm made up The Brothers Grimm. The two brothers compiled folk music and literature and created their <i>Kinder-und Hausmärchen</i> - the Grimm fairy tales. Their work led to the modern study of folklore, and many children's stories that are told in modern times. The stories that these brothers created and compiled are used as the base stories for many Disney movies and stories.</p>

	           <p class="sides">Disney took these stories that the Brothers Grimm had compiled and brightened them up to allow for a younger audience. This meant that some main points to the story needed to be altered so that they would not be as scary to children and would allow for a brighter ending. Since some main points were modified, the two versions look similar at times and very different at other times. This site will portray each side of the story visually to point out some of the liberties that Disney took when recreating the classic fairy-tail.</p>

	           <p class="sides">When the site first opens the user will see the base of a tower and it will lift the eye-line to the top of the tower as the website loads. Once the screen reaches the top of the tower it will fade to white and then the title will appear. When the user scrolls down there will be a short explanation of how the site will work. </p>


	           <p class="sides">The web page will be split in half with the left side showing the Grimm version and the right side showing the Disney version. There will be illustrations behind each story to allow the viewer to experience the differences in the stories. The stories will be told as the viewer scrolls down the page making the page shift to the next illustration bringing the viewer to the next part of the stories. Since the scrolling will be shifting the stories simultaneously, it will allow for the points of the story to directly relate to each other to allow for a better comparison. For the main part of the site, the viewer will be able to scroll with the text at their own pace so that they can properly read both sides of the page and fully digest the differences.</p>

	           <p class="sides"> The illustrations for the stories would sit either behind the test as a background, or it will sit next to the text, depending on the necessity of the story for details. For example, the point in the story when the baby is born could be a cradle behind the text because a viewer will understand what the object is without the need for details, but points in the story with specific building layout or visual aids would be set beside the text for easier viewing. The Disney side will be illustrated with a heavy influence from the movie, and the Grimm side will be heavily influenced by source material from the Grimm stories and my take on them.</p>

	           <p class="sides"> The color scheme of the site will be two-sided. The Brothers Grimm side will be black, and white with dull colors, and will feel monochromatic and harsh. On the other side, the Disney story will be brighter and consist of more color and a cheerier feeling. This use of color will allow for further differentiation between the stories, and how they are meant to make the viewer feel. The Brothers Grimm had a much rougher approach to telling the stories, while Disney has a much brighter approach meant for children.</p>

	           <p class="sides"> At the end of the site will be the classic “The End” tag hovering on-screen with the tower in the background. I want the site to begin the story with the tower and end the story with the tower since that is one of the main visual aspects of the story that people remember.</p>
